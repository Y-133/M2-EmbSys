    The project is all about developing and playing the fun nintendo like games using the Atmega based Arduino controller. The project can be more precisely defined as handheld game console which is a small, portable self-contained video game console with a built-in screen, game controls and speakers. Handheld game consoles are smaller than home video game consoles and contain the console, screen, speakers, and controls in one unit, allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place. This console is brained by Arduino with a marvelous display screen. The game is controlled using the joystick and few buttons. The console has dedicated on/off switch and a dedicated automatic cooling system that keeps the console cool.
    The handhed gaming console is simulated using SIMULIDE software. The development board Arduino UNO based out of ATMEGA 328P , which is the brain of the console is used.The cooling system for the console and the battery is used to keep the temoerature in limit. The RTD 2 wire sensor is used to capture the temperature. The DC brushless motor ( BDLC) is used for effective ventilation purpose. The OLED screen acts as the face of the console, where the game play is displayed. The piezo buzzer is used for the game play audio output. This gives the user an immersive experience. </p>
