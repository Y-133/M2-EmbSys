# Description:
  This Project presents a women safety device with GPS tracking and alerts using Aduino based on Atmega 328P controller. The system can be interconnected with the alarm system 
  and alert the neighbors. This detection and messaging system is composed of a GPS receiver, Aduino and a GSM Modem. GPS Receiver gets the location information from satellites in the form of latitude
  and longitude.The ARDUINO processes this information and this processed information is sent to the user using GSM modem A GSM modem is interfaced to the ARDUINO. The GSM modem 
  sends an SMS to the predefined mobile number. When a woman is in danger and in need of selfdefense then she can press the switch which is allotted to her. By pressing the switch, the entire system will be activated.
  
  With all the technology available to us in recent times, it's not hard to build a safety device for women which will not only generate an emergency alarm but also send a message
  to your friends, family, or concerned person. Here we will build a band that can be worn by women, using which they can inform police or anyone, using SOS emergency SMS along
  with the current location. Using this information, the police will be able to save the victim from the location. For this, here we are using an Arduino which can be interfaced
  with GSM and GPS module for sending SMS alerts and getting the location coordinates. We have also used an RF Transmitter and receiver module for wireless communication between
  the Band and Receiving device with GPS/GSM.
